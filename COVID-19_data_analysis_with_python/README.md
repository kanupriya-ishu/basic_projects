# Covid19 Data Analysis using Python
 
I have preprocessed and merged data sets in this project to quantify appropriate steps and prepare them for an analysis. This project uses the dataset of COVID19, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of data relating to the cumulative number of confirmed cases per day in each country.
There is also another World Happiness Report dataset consisting of various life factors, rated by the people living around the globe in each world. I've merged these two datasets to see if there is a relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are living in that country.
## Libraries used:

### 1. pandas
To install pandas
```
$pip install pandas
```

### 2. numpy
To install numpy
```
$pip install numpy
```

### 3. seaborn
To install seaborn
```
$pip install seaborn
```

### 4. matplotlib
To install matplotlib
```
$pip install matplotlib
```

### Follow the following steps to complete the project: 

#### Step 1:
Import COVID19 dataset and prepare it for the analysis by dropping unncecessary columns and aggregating rows.

#### Step 2: 
Use different methods of the mentioned libraries to find a good measure like finding maximum infection rate.

#### Step 3: 
Import World happiness report dataset and drop the unncecessary columns. Create a new dataframe and merge this dataset with COVID19 dataset and find correlations among data.

#### Step 4: 
Visualise the results using seaborn library.

All the datasets are included in Datasets folder.
