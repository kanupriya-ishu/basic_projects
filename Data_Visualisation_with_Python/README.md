# Data Visualisation with Python

## Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data.
## In this project, I have created an application that reads data from CSV files.I have visualised the data using various techniques using existing Python libraries namely pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

## Libraries required:
### 1) pandas
To install using pip: pip install pandas

### 2) matplotlib
To install using pip: pip install matplotlib

### 3) seaborn
To install using pip: pip install seaborn

### Task 1:
1) I have created a table using Pandas dataframe and printed it.
2) I have printed statistics based on the table values.
3) I have create a Line graph with an X axis and Y axis using Pandas.
4) Finally, I have shown a window showing the graph using Matplotlibâ€™s pyplot.
 
### Task 2:
1) Created a Pyplot plot using Temperature and Month.
2) Created a Pyplot using Month and Temperature.
3) Created a Pyplot plot using Month on the X axis, Temperature and Rainfall together on the Y.
3) Finally, I have created a Legend for the graph for distinction.

### Task 3:
1) Made use of the Seaborn library.
2) Built atop MatplotLib.
3) Created a plot with individual data points scattered.
4) Finally, created a regression to show possible correlation.

### Task 4:
1) Used heatmap which is popular type of graph used for spotting large and small values quickly.
2) Sometimes it is required for data to be reorganized into a Matrix using pivots.
3) Has a color key on the side.
4) Created using a new births data set: (month, year, number of births)

### Task 5:
1) Used jointplot which good for looking at distribution and data points at the same time.
2) It has option to display different kind of graph- the parameter called kind.
3) Here, I have scattered with regression line, as well as distribution.

All the csv and json files used in the project are included.
